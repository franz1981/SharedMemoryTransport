Design of SHM
-------------

Date:   June 2021

The idea is that every member creates its ManyToOneRingBuffer queue under LOCATION, e.g. /dev/shm/<clustername>/uuid-1
(the UUID is the unique 16-byte identity of a member). When a member leaves or crashes, this buffer is removed.

Every member continually calls rb.read(MessageHandler) to receive messages.

Every member maintains a hashmap of UUIDs/ManyToOneRingBuffers.

A multicast message writes the message to all buffers except self.

A unicast message looks up the buffer associated with the target address and write the data to it.
